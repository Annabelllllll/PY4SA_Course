    "### Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "Nowadays there are so many libraries to work with spatial data using Python, describing all those libraries would be require a huge among of time. However in this module we will describe the most relevant ones, and from here you will get the basics that are needed to work in the future with similar libraries. \n",
    "\n",
    "All libraries have their own pros and cons. Below is a list of some common tools for geospatial analysis in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [**ArcPy**](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/tool-reference/main/arcgis-pro-tool-reference.htm): Python site package integrated into the **ArcGIS Pro** software environments. ArcPy can be used within ArcGIS Pro via the Python window. ArcGIS Pro now includes **Jupyter Notebook** as part of the base installation. You can also work within notebooks inside of ArcGIS Pro. One relevant Con is Esri Technologies are not free or open-source, so in this module we are limited to work or discuss but in the future module you will learn how to use it. ArcGIS and particularly ArcPY are very powerful and worth investigating. I personally use ArcPy a lot in my own work. Besides it might the most documented tool among the rest.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. [**GeoPandas**](https://geopandas.org/): You new bestie in Python. Expands **Pandas** to allow for working with vector data using the **Series** and **DataFrame** structures. I will provide an introduction to GeoPandas in this module, which will build upon our prior discussion of Pandas. GeoPandas relies on several dependencies including the following which we have already discussed: **NumPy**, **Pandas**, and **matplotlib**. It also relies on the following libraries/modules:\n",
    "    - [**Shapely**](https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/latest/): used to perform geometric and overlay operations.\n",
    "    - [**Fiona**](https://fiona.readthedocs.io/en/latest/): used to read and write geospatial data files via links to the **Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL)**\n",
    "    - [**PyProj**](https://github.com/pyproj4/pyproj): interface to **PROJ** and allows for reading and transformation of geographic and projected coordinate systems. \n",
    "    - [**MapClassify**](https://pysal.org/mapclassify/): allows for choropleth mapping. \n",
    "    - [**Descartes**](https://pypi.org/project/descartes/): use vector geospatial features with matplotlib.\n",
    "  \n",
    "3. [**Rasterio**](https://rasterio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html): allows for reading, writing, and manipulation of raster geospatial data. This package relies heavily on NumPy so that rasters can be manipulated as arrays. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. [**Contextily**](https://github.com/geopandas/contextily): allows for retrieval of **raster tile layers** for use as base maps within matplotlib plots. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. [**EarthPy**](https://earthpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/): expands the functionality of GeoPandas and Rasterio. Very useful for raster and multispectral image analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "6. [**WhiteboxTools**](https://jblindsay.github.io/wbt_book/intro.html): provides more than 440 tools for analyzing geospatial data, including tools for data preparation, vector analysis and overlay, raster and image analysis, geomorphometric analysis, hydrological analysis, and LiDAR processing. These tools can be accessed in Python, R, QGIS, and via a command-line interface. They can also be accessed via a graphical user interface (GUI) known as [**Whitebox GAT**](https://jblindsay.github.io/ghrg/Whitebox/). This tool set was developed by [Dr. John Lindsay](https://jblindsay.github.io/ghrg/index.html) of the Geomorphometry & Hydrogeomatics Research Group at the University of Guelph.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we are limited by only one lecture we can briefly cover an intro of GeoPandas and Rasteio, but in future modules we will have more time to dig into those resources. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Content\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Read and write vector geospatial data using **GeoPandas**.\n",
    "2. Read and write raster geospatial data using **Rasterio**.\n",
    "3. Visualize geospatial data and make maps using **GeoPandas**, **Rasterio**, and **matplotlib**.\n",
    "4. Perform a wide variety of spatial analysis tasks using **WhiteboxTools** (This is optional, and will be included in the next version of this module)"
